# Tunnel-Surrounding-Rock-Image-Classification-Algorithm-in-TBM
Applied three supervised learning algorithms to establish a classification model for the surrounding rock
level based on a combination of TBM rock breaking patterns and information from the excavation data.

â€¢ Created semi-supervised learning models. FixMatch and MixMatch were used for surrounding rock
classification, and the performance of the models were analyzed at different data set scales.
